# Tasks:

1. Consider a Component has html/css/js pages. All the HTML/CSS/JS should load dynamically for component based on data in database.
Say Component A has 3 Themes â€“ theme 1, theme 2, theme 3

   http://localhost:3001/ switch the user and the particular theme will be loaded depends upon user selection


2. If database of the user, has theme 3 for the page, then the user should see theme 3 for the particular user
Add OpenGraph MetaTags to website dynamically, such that all the data should come from db. When you share the link on any social media facebook/twitter, image i.e. loaded from database should be visible in share post.

   Please refer https://github.com/ananthsoftcare/react-share

3. Create one example component in which will share components (HTML/CSS/JS) with one other component in React.

   Dropdown (https://github.com/ananthsoftcare/react-theme/blob/master/client/src/components/common/dropdown.js) is the component can be shared with other components. Example (https://github.com/ananthsoftcare/react-theme/blob/master/client/src/components/theme.js#L50)
